# CTRL + F Capture to Google Analytics

Recently I was thinking it would be pretty cool to see what people have been trying to find on pages of my sites.

My main analytics tool is Google Analytics so I figured the best thing for me would be to capture what was searched for and send that to GA as an event.

## Disclaimer

This is still under active development. If weird things happen I can only apologise but there will no doubt be bugs for a while!

## Usage

Include the minified script at the bottom of your webpage, assuming you are using the latest Google Analytics tracking codes then your in page searches should start being logged.

You can test this using the events real time view inside of Google Analytics.

I can answer any questions you have on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tosbourn), or you can create an issue (see below)

## Pull Requests

Right now there are no tests, so pull requests will be manually vetted by me, they will need to address an existing issue before I will consider merging anything.
